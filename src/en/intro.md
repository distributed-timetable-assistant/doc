# **Introduction**

The **Distributed Timetable Assistant (DTA)** is a decentralized platform designed to automate and optimize educational scheduling across multiple institutions, instructors, supervisors, and learners.  
Unlike traditional centralized systems, DTA distributes the process of generating and evaluating timetable solutions across independent microservices — enabling scalability, flexibility, and open participation.

## Vision

DTA aims to create an **open, collaborative, and distributed scheduling ecosystem** where educational organizations and independent solver nodes can interact through a shared marketplace.  
This approach allows institutions to:
- Delegate scheduling tasks to distributed solvers.
- Define specific academic constraints and preferences.
- Receive optimized timetable solutions without exposing sensitive internal data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Decentralized Scheduling
Each educational institution defines its own packet of rules, participants, and facilities. These packets are sent to the DTA network, where independent solver microservices propose scheduling solutions.

### 2. Solver Marketplace
DTA operates as a **shared solver marketplace**, allowing contributors to:
- Deploy their own solver services.
- Compete or collaborate in producing optimal timetables.
- Earn rewards for accepted or high-quality solutions.

### 3. Privacy and Autonomy
Institutions maintain **control over their data** while participating in the distributed ecosystem.  
DTA ensures:
- Private deployment options.
- Secure communication between solvers and institutions.
- Configurable visibility and data-sharing levels.

## Core Capabilities

- **Collaborative Matchstage:** Enables multiple solvers to refine solutions iteratively.  
- **Open Solver Contribution:** Developers can publish and monetize their solver algorithms.  
- **Self-Hosted Resource Services:** Institutions can host their own scheduling nodes.  
- **Private Deployment Option:** Provides flexibility for sensitive or local environments.  
- **Privacy and Anonymity:** Protects organizational and participant data in shared environments.

## Scalability and Reliability

DTA is built for **scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility**, leveraging distributed microservices to handle scheduling workloads efficiently.  
Through iterative refinement and peer collaboration, the system improves scheduling quality over time while maintaining high system resilience.
