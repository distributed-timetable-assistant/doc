# **Introduction**

The **Distributed Timetable Assistant (DTA)** is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize educational scheduling. By moving away from traditional, centralized algorithms, DTA empowers institutions, instructors, and learners to collaboratively build optimized timetables.

Instead of a single bottleneck, DTA uses a network of independent **Solver Services** that compete to solve scheduling problems defined by **Institution Packets**. This approach ensures scalability, fairness, and the ability to handle complex, real-world constraints that centralized systems often miss.

For a deeper dive into how DTA works, see the [Overview](overview.md).
